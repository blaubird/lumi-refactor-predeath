   - Improved maintainability and readability

2. **Standardized Models**
   - Moved from a single models.py file to individual model files
   - Standardized on SQLAlchemy 2.x syntax exclusively
   - Created a proper Base class for all models to inherit from

3. **Fixed Alembic Configuration**
   - Updated env.py to properly handle environment variables
   - Created a single initial migration with the complete schema
   - Eliminated the risk of enum type duplication errors

4. **Improved Webhook Handler**
   - Simplified the webhook handler implementation
   - Added proper verification for Meta webhooks
   - Moved webhook logic to a dedicated endpoint module

5. **Added Setup Scripts**
   - Created setup_db.py for database initialization
   - Created create_tenant.py for test tenant creation
   - Eliminated the need for multiple fix scripts


## Next Steps

3. Update CI/CD pipeline to include migration checks
4. Consider adding more robust error handling and monitoring
